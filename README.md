# listking

This was a project I took upon myself before I started school at The 
Iron Yard. I used help from the JQuery/JS tutorials to get the .js
part down. The CSS though was just from me looking at the pictures in
the book and trying to recreate them myself. The HTML could be found
a few pages prior.
